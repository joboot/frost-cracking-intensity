# Program to calculate and determine frost cracking intensity
# Programmer: Jordan Booth
# Date: 2021.09.27

# inputs:
# MAT (mean annual Temperature)
# max summer Temp
# min winter Temp
# z (depth)
# change in z (change in depth)
# dT/dz (change in temp over change in depth)
# T should stay in between 0 - -15

# outputs:
# FCI (frost cracking intensity)
# depth to 0 FCI
